# algorithm-to-control-the-leg-movement-of-a-robot-using-SG90-servo-motors-in-Arduino
This project controls the leg movement of a robot using SG90 servo motors and an Arduino. It implements a basic walking cycle by coordinating hip and knee servos. The code initializes the servos, sets initial positions, and defines parameters for step length, foot lift height, and movement speed. The main loop executes the walking cycle.
